- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I consulted with Amy Tang and Cola Shi while working on this assignment.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attened the TA hours in Tuesday 7-9PM EST.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I think it is interesting and challenging for me at first. It has some similarities with Python, but it is also hard for me to change the rules that I follow in Python into Java. However, after I get more familiar with it, I find that Java is a language that is very organzied and easy to go with.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
For me, Python does not need to add the types of the parameters everytime when we defining a new parameter but Java does. However,they have the same logic like using loops, printing, and defining the functions.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
At first I cannot successfully mirroring the names when they are at the end of a sentence. This is because they are ending with the punctuation. After I remove the punctuations of them, I have run the code successfully.
